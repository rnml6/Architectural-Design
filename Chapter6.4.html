        <h2>Application architectures</h2>
        <div>
          Application systems are intended to meet a business or organizational need. All businesses have much in common—they need to hire people, issue invoices, keep accounts, and so on. Businesses operating in the same sector use common sector-specific applications. Therefore, as well as general business functions, all phone companies need systems to connect calls, manage their network, issue bills to customers, etc. Consequently, the application systems used by these businesses also have much in common. These commonalities have led to the development of software architectures that describe the structure and organization of particular types of software systems. Application architectures encapsulate the principal characteristics of a class of systems. For example, in real-time systems, there might be generic architectural models of different system types, such as data collection systems or monitoring systems. Although instances of these systems differ in detail, the common architectural structure can be reused when developing new systems of the same type. The application architecture may be re-implemented when developing new systems but, for many business systems, application reuse is possible without re-implementation. We see this in the growth of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems from companies such as SAP and Oracle, and vertical software packages (COTS) for specialized applications in different areas of business. In these systems, a generic system is configured and adapted to create a specific business application.

        There are several examples of application architectures on the book’s website. These include descriptions of batch data-processing systems, resource allocation systems, and event-based editing systems.<br>

        For example, a system for supply chain management can be adapted for different types of suppliers, goods, and contractual arrangements.<br>

        1. As a starting point for the architectural design process. If you are unfamiliar with the type of application you are developing, you can base your initial design on a generic application architecture. This will need to be specialized for the specific system being developed, but it is a good starting point.

    There are many types of application system and, in some cases, they may seem to be very different. However, many of these superficially dissimilar applications actually have much in common, and thus can be represented by a single abstract application architecture.

        Transaction processing applications are database-centered applications that process user requests for information and update the information in a database. These are the most common type of interactive business systems. They are organized in such a way that user actions can’t interfere with each other and the integrity of the database is maintained.

        The best-known language processing systems are compilers, which translate high-level language programs into machine code.

      <p>
        Transaction processing (TP) systems are designed to process user requests for information from a database, or requests to update a database (Lewis et al., 2003). Technically, a database transaction is a sequence of operations that is treated as a single unit (an atomic unit). All of the operations in a transaction have to be completed before the database changes are made permanent. This ensures that failure of operations within the transaction does not lead to inconsistencies in the database.

    <div class="bg-white p-5 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed animate-[fadeIn_1s_ease-in-out]">
      <p>
        From a user perspective, a transaction is any coherent sequence of operations that satisfies a goal, such as ‘find the times of flights from London to Paris’. If the user transaction does not require the database to be changed then it may not be necessary to package this as a technical database transaction.

      <p>
        An example of a transaction is a customer request to withdraw money from a bank account using an ATM. This involves getting details of the customer’s account, checking the balance, modifying the balance by the amount withdrawn, and sending commands to the ATM to deliver the cash. Until all of these steps have been completed, the transaction is incomplete and the customer accounts database is not changed. Transaction processing systems are usually interactive systems in which users make asynchronous requests for service.

      <p>
        Figure 6.14 illustrates the conceptual architectural structure of TP applications. First a user makes a request to the system through an I/O processing component. The request is processed by some application-specific logic. A transaction is created and passed to a transaction manager,<img src="src/assets/img/hhh.jpg" alt="" /> which is usually embedded in the database management system. After the transaction manager has ensured that the transaction is properly completed, it signals to the application that processing has finished.

        Transaction processing systems may be organized as a ‘pipe and filter’ architecture with system components responsible for input, processing, and output. For example, consider a banking system that allows customers to query their accounts and withdraw cash from an ATM. The system is composed of two cooperating software components—the ATM software and the account processing software in the bank’s database server. The input and output components are implemented as software in the ATM and the processing component is part of the bank’s database server.

    <p>All systems that involve interaction with a shared database can be considered to be transaction-based information systems. An information system allows controlled access to a large base of information, such as a library catalog, a flight timetable, or the records of patients in a hospital. Increasingly, information systems are web-based systems that are accessed through a web browser.</p>

  <div class="row-span-2 p-4 bg-white shadow rounded col-span-1 transition-transform duration-500 ease-in-out hover:rotate-[360deg]">
    <p>Figure 6.16 shows a very general model of an information system. The system is modeled using a layered approach (discussed in Section 6.3) where the top layer supports the user interface and the bottom layer is the system database. The user communications layer handles all input and output from the user interface, and the information retrieval layer includes application-specific logic for accessing and updating the database. As we shall see later, the layers in this model can map directly onto servers in an Internet-based system.</p>

      <li>The top layer is responsible for implementing the user interface. In this case, the UI has been implemented using a web browser.</li>
      <li>The second layer provides the user interface functionality that is delivered through the web browser. It includes components to allow users to log in to the system and checking components that ensure that the operations they use are allowed by their role. This layer includes form and menu management components that present information to users, and data validation components that check information consistency.</li>

      <li>The lowest layer, which is built using a commercial database management system, provides transaction management and persistent data storage. Information and resource management systems are now usually web-based systems where the user interfaces are implemented using a web browser.</li>

  <div class="col-span-4 row-start-5 p-4 bg-white shadow rounded transition-transform duration-500 ease-in-out hover:rotate-[360deg]">
    <p>The organization of servers in these systems usually reflects the four-layer generic model presented in Figure 6.16. These systems are often implemented as multi-tier client server architectures, as discussed in Chapter 18:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1">
      <li>The web server is responsible for all user communications, with the user interface implemented using a web browser.</li>
      <li>The application server is responsible for implementing application-specific logic as well as information storage and retrieval requests.</li>
      <li>The database server moves information to and from the database and handles transaction management.</li>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">6.4.3 Language Processing Systems</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Language processing systems translate a natural or artificial language into another representation of that language and, for programming languages, may also execute the resulting code. In software engineering, compilers translate an artificial programming language into machine code. Other language-processing systems may translate an XML data description into commands to query a database or to an alternative XML representation. Natural language processing systems may translate one natural language to another e.g., French to Norwegian.
  </p>
  <p>
    A possible architecture for a language processing system for a programming language is illustrated in Figure 6.18. The source language instructions define the program to be executed and a translator converts these into instructions for an abstract machine. These instructions are then interpreted by another component that fetches the instructions for execution and executes them using (if necessary) data from the environment. The output of the process is the result of interpreting the instructions on the input data.

      References architectures
      Reference architectures capture important features of system architectures in a domain. Essentially, they include
      everything that might be in an application architecture although, in reality, it is very unlikely that any individual
      application would include all the features shown in a reference architecture. The main purpose of reference
      architectures is to evaluate and compare design proposals, and to educate people about architectural
      characteristics in that domain.

      5. A semantic analyzer that uses information from the syntax tree and the symbol
      table to check the semantic correctness of the input language text.

      6. A code generator that ‘walks’ the syntax tree and generates abstract machine code.

      Other components might also be included which analyze and transform the syntax tree to improve efficiency and remove redundancy from the generated machine code. In other types of language processing system, such as a natural language translator, there will be additional components such as a dictionary, and the generated code is actually the input text translated into another language.
      There are alternative architectural patterns that may be used in a language processing system (Garlan and Shaw, 1993). Compilers can be implemented using a composite of a repository and a pipe and filter model. In a compiler architecture, the symbol table is a repository for shared data. The phases of lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis are organized sequentially, as shown in Figure 6.19, and communicate through the shared symbol table.
      This pipe and filter model of language compilation is effective in batch environments where programs are compiled and executed without user interaction; for example, in the translation of one XML document to another. It is less effective when a compiler is integrated with other language processing tools such as a structured editing system, an interactive debugger or a program prettyprinter. In this situation, changes from one component need to be reflected immediately in other components. It is better, therefore, to organize the system around a repository, as shown in Figure 6.20.
      This figure illustrates how a language processing system can be part of an integrated set of programming support tools. In this example, the symbol table and syntax tree act as a central information repository. Tools or tool fragments communicate through it.
      Other information that is sometimes embedded in tools, such as the grammar definition and the definition of the output format for the program, have been taken out of the tools and put into the repository. Therefore, a syntax-directed editor can check that the syntax of a program is correct as it is being typed and a prettyprinter can create listings of the program in a format that is easy to read.

        A software architecture is a description of how a software system is organized.
        Properties of a system such as performance, security, and availability are influenced by the architecture used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Architectural design decisions include decisions on the type of application, the distribution of the system,
        the architectural styles to be used, and the ways in which the architecture should be documented and evaluated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Architectures may be documented from several different perspectives or views.
        Possible views include a conceptual view, a logical view, a process view, a development view, and a physical view.
      </li>
      <li>
        Architectural patterns are a means of reusing knowledge about generic system architectures.
        They describe the architecture, explain when it may be used, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Commonly used architectural patterns include Model-View-Controller, Layered Architecture,
        Repository, Client–server, and Pipe and Filter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generic models of application systems architectures help us understand the operation of applications,
        compare applications of the same type, validate application system designs,
        and assess large-scale components for reuse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transaction processing systems are interactive systems that allow information in a database to be remotely accessed
        and modified by a number of users. Information systems and resource management systems are examples of transaction processing systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Language processing systems are used to translate texts from one language into another and to carry out the instructions
        specified in the input language. They include a translator and an abstract machine that executes the generated language.
      </li>

        <strong>Software Architecture: Perspectives on an Emerging Discipline.</strong> This was the first book on software architecture and has a good discussion on different architectural styles. (M. Shaw and D. Garlan, Prentice-Hall, 1996.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Software Architecture in Practice, 2nd ed.</strong> This is a practical discussion of software architectures that does not oversell the benefits of architectural design. It provides a clear business rationale explaining why architectures are important. (L. Bass, P. Clements and R. Kazman, Addison-Wesley, 2003.)

        <strong>‘The Golden Age of Software Architecture’.</strong> This paper surveys the development of software architecture from its beginnings in the 1980s through to its current usage. There is little technical content but it is an interesting historical overview. (M. Shaw and P. Clements, IEEE Software, 21 (2), March–April 2006.)

        <strong>Handbook of Software Architecture.</strong> This is a work in progress by Grady Booch, one of the early evangelists for software architecture. He has been documenting the architectures of a range of software systems so you can see reality rather than academic abstraction. Available on the Web and intended to appear as a book.
