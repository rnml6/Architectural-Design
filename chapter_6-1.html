              Architectural design is a creative process where you design a
              system organization that will satisfy the functional and
              non-functional requirements of a system. Because it is a creative
              process, the activities within the process depend on the type of
              system being developed, the background and experience of the
              system architect, and the specific requirements for the system. It
              is therefore useful to think of architectural design as a series
              of decisions to be made rather than a sequence of activities.

              Although each software system is unique, systems in the same
              application domain often have similar architectures that reflect
              the fundamental concepts of the domain. For example, application
              product lines are applications that are built around a core
              architecture with variants that satisfy specific customer
              requirements. When designing a system architecture, you have to
              decide what your system and broader application classes have in
              common, and decide how much knowledge from these application
              architectures you can reuse.

              If performance is a critical requirement, the architecture should

              of com ponents, with these components all deployed on the same
              computer rather than distributed across the network. This may mean
              using a few relatively large com ponents rather than small,
              fine-grain components, which reduces the number of component
              communications. You may also consider run-time system organiza
              tions that allow the system to be replicated and executed on
              different processors.

              reduces the costs and problems of safety val idation and makes it

              be separated from consumers and shared data structures should be
              avoided.

            For embedded systems and systems designed for personal computers,
            there is usually only a single processor and you will not have to
            design a distributed architec ture for the system. However, most
            large systems are now distributed systems in which the system
            software is distributed across many different computers. The choice
            of distribution architecture is a key decision that affects the
            performance and reliability of the system. This is a major topic in
            its own right and I cover it sepa rately in Chapter 18.

            The architecture of a software system may be based on a particular
            architectural pattern or style. An architectural pattern is a
            description of a system organization (Garlan and Shaw, 1993), such
            as a client–server organization or a layered architecture.
            Architectural patterns capture the essence of an architecture that
            has been used in dif ferent software systems. You should be aware of
            common patterns, where they can be used, and their strengths and
            weaknesses when making decisions about the architec ture of a
            system. I discuss a number of frequently used patterns in Section
            6.3.

            Garlan and Shaw’s notion of an architectural style (style and
            pattern have come to mean the same thing) covers questions 4 to 6 in
            the previous list. You have to choose the most appropriate
            structure, such as client–server or layered structuring, that will
            enable you to meet the system requirements. To decompose structural
            system units, you decide on the strategy for decomposing components
            into sub-components. The approaches that you can use allow different
            types of architecture to be implemented. Finally, in the control
            modeling process, you make decisions about how the execu tion of
            components is controlled. You develop a general model of the control
            rela tionships between the various parts of the system.

            Obviously there is potential conflict between some of these
            architectures. For example, using large components improves
            performance and using small, fine-grain components improves
            maintainability. If both performance and maintainability are
            important system requirements, then some compromise must be found.
            This can sometimes be achieved by using different architectural
            patterns or styles for different parts of the system.

            Evaluating an architectural design is difficult because the true
            test of an architec ture is how well the system meets its functional
            and non-functional requirements when it is in use. However, you can
            do some evaluation by comparing your design against reference
            architectures or generic architectural patterns. Bosch’s (2000)
            description of the non-functional characteristics of architectural
            patterns can also be used to help with architectural evaluation.
